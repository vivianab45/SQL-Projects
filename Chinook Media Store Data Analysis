# For this project, I downloaded a dataset called Chinook, which represents a digital media store.
# This dataset includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName, LastName,CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country !='USA'
ORDER BY country;

#Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName,CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil'
ORDER BY FirstName;

#Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT customers.FirstName,invoices.InvoiceId,invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices 

Left Join chinook.customers
ON chinook.invoices.CustomerId=chinook.customers.CustomerId
WHERE invoices.BillingCountry='Brazil';

#Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title='Sales Support Agent';

#Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry;

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

#Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

#How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) AS total_invoices_2009
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) AS total_invoices_2009, SUM(total) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.


#Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

#Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

#Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

#Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
